Problem: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day. 
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
input:  prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
output : maxProfit = 5

public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    if (prices == null || prices.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int maxProfit = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
            minPrice = prices[i];
        } else if (prices[i] - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = prices[i] - minPrice;
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
}

Stock selling variations:

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the i-th day. You may buy and sell the stock multiple times (one share at a time).
You must sell before buying again. Your goal is to maximize total profit. Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

private static int getMaxProfitWithMultipleBuys(int[] a) {
    int n = a.length;
    if (a == null || n == 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Please provide valid input");
    }

    int cumulativeProfit = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] > a[i - 1]) {
            cumulativeProfit += a[i] - a[i - 1];
        }
    }

    return cumulativeProfit;
}
